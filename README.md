Given two integers x and y. Both have a length of length n digits. To find z = x * y

It is assumed that both x and y have the same digit length. The problem can be extended to cases where they are not the same number of digits.

To do this  appropriate number of zeros can be added to the left of the smaller of the two integers.

In total the maximum number of basic operations this grade-school algorithm needs to use is 4n^2. This is the worst case running time for multiplication.
